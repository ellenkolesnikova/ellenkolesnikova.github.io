AI/Medicine: Safe+Natal
============
Paper reporting on Safe+Natal work on improving pregnancy outcomes in Guatemala through an app that can conduct medical triage: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09659. Worked 3-5 hours a week since Sept 2023, plus audited several AI courses in preparation (hundreds of hours).



Crypto/AI: Private Repair of User-Flagged Failures in Text-to-Image Services
============
Internship with Prof. Xiao Wang (Northwestern University). Work is on using cryptographic tools (namely secure multiparty computation) to securely remove bias from generative AI models. Consider the setting where a privately owned pre-trained model may be biased, e.g., it would only generate images of men in leadership positions. The goal is to use external party’s advice (which may also be sensitive) to fine tune the model to eliminate the bias. We achieve this by computing on encrypted data. Worked 3-5 hours a week since Aug 2024, plus audited several advanced cryptography courses in preparation (hundreds of hours).  Paper was submitted to NeurIPS 2025, a top AI venue.


AI/Digital Humanities: Identifying the author of a Medieval text
============
Collaboration with Georgia Tech’s Prof. Juliana Viezure and her student on using AI to attribute authorship of a medieval Latin text. Manuscript is in preparation for submission to a history journal.  Worked for 3 hours/week for 3 months.
