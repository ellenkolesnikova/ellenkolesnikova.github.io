Medicine: Safe+Natal
============
I am working with [safe+natal](https://safenatal.org/){:target="_blank"} on improving pregnancy healthcare in rural Guatemala through ML-based diagnostics and triage. More specifically, the goal of this project is to provide a simple system that enables rural midwives from underserved communities to conduct basic pregnancy monitoring and identify cases that need to be referred to hospitals. We distributed $200 health monitor kits (including smartphone and very basic devices such as BP monitors and 1-dimensional doppler ultrasounds) to local midwives. Indigenous Maya communities do not commonly use written language, so we automatically transcribe and interpret readings from the health devices to enable timely healthcare decisions. Safe+Natal is tremendously successful: integrated with a Mayan hospital, it reduced maternal mortality from one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere to nearly zero! 

My role in this larger project is to develop and test image recognition software that transcribes readings from a blood pressure monitor. The challenge in this is to create an accurate model that works with all types of lighting and backgrounds.

Crypto: Private Repair of User-Flagged Failures in Text-to-Image Services
============
Internship with Prof. Xiao Wang (Northwestern University). Work is on using cryptographic tools (namely secure multiparty computation) to securely remove bias from generative AI models. Consider the setting where a privately owned pre-trained model may be biased, e.g., it would only generate images of men in leadership positions. The goal is to use external party’s advice (which may also be sensitive) to fine tune the model to eliminate the bias. We achieve this by computing on encrypted data. Worked 3-5 hours a week since Aug 2024, plus audited several advanced cryptography courses in preparation (hundreds of hours).  Paper was submitted to NeurIPS 2025, a top AI venue.


Digital Humanities: Identifying the author of a Medieval text
============
Collaboration with Georgia Tech’s Prof. Juliana Viezure and her student on using AI to attribute authorship of a medieval Latin text. Manuscript is in preparation for submission to a history journal.  Worked for 3 hours/week for 3 months.
