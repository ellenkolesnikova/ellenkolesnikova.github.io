Medicine: Safe+Natal
============
I am working with [safe+natal](https://safenatal.org/){:target="_blank"} on improving pregnancy healthcare in rural Guatemala through ML-based diagnostics and triage. More specifically, the goal of this project is to provide a simple system that enables rural midwives from underserved communities to conduct basic pregnancy monitoring and identify cases that need to be referred to hospitals. We distributed $200 health monitor kits (including smartphone and very basic devices such as blood pressure monitors and 1-dimensional doppler ultrasounds) to local midwives. Indigenous Maya communities do not commonly use written language, so we automatically transcribe and interpret readings from the health devices to enable timely healthcare decisions. Safe+Natal is tremendously successful: integrated with a Mayan hospital, it reduced maternal mortality from one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere to nearly zero! 

My role in this larger project is to develop and test image recognition software that transcribes readings from an image of a blood pressure monitor (taken on the smartphones given to midwives). The challenge in this is to create an accurate system that works with all types of lighting and backgrounds.

Crypto: Private Repair of User-Flagged Failures in Text-to-Image Services
============
This project focuses on using cryptographic tools (namely secure multiparty computation) to securely remove bias from generative AI models. Consider the setting where a privately owned pre-trained model may be biased, e.g., it only generates images of men (not women) in leadership positions. The goal is to use an external party’s advice (which is also private) to finetune the model to eliminate the specific bias. We achieve this by computing on encrypted data.

Work done as a part of an internship with Prof. Xiao Wang (Northwestern University); the resulting paper was submitted to NeurIPS 2025.

Digital Humanities: Identifying the author of a Medieval text
============



Collaboration with Georgia Tech’s Prof. Juliana Viezure and her student on using AI to attribute authorship of a medieval Latin text. Manuscript is in preparation for submission to a history journal.
